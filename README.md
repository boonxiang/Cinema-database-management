Case Study:
Great Cinema Complex (GCC) operates cinema complexes throughout Malaysia. Each cinema complex has
between 1 to 2 halls, with varying seating capacity and specialised equipment. Each hall can be used to screen
movies or host private events. Anyone can book a hall for events, subject to availability and management
approval. Charges for rental of the halls can be RM10 per hour to the current terms and conditions.
Movies are screened every friday, saturday and sunday, from as early as 11 am to the last show at 11.30 pm. The
popularity of a movie will determine how many shows and how many halls per day. Movie schedules are
prepared two-weeks in advance and can be adjusted everyday as necessary. Ticket prices for movies range from
RM35 to Rm15 per ticket, day, cinema hall and popularity of the movie. Movie tickets can be bundled with
food/drinks for a special price. A menu is available for customers to add on food/drinks when purchasing
tickets.Customers who are GCC MovieClub members can collect points when purchasing tickets. Points can be
used to redeem special prizes or offset the price of movie tickets. Members get two complimentary tickets
(standard hall) with each membership renewal. Members may also be able to claim prizes/complimentary items
during special promotions. Members can claim two complimentary tickets (standard hall) during the month of
their birthdays. Management will decide what movies or which show schedule can offer complimentary tickets.
For example, complimentary tickets are not available for blockbuster movies in the first two weeks of screening
